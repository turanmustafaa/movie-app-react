## About Project

    *I developed the project with typeScript.

    *I developed the project responsively for mobile tablet and PC screens.

    *I wrote the project in a scalable way. (In other words, this project can be enlarged much more without the need to change the architecture. At this point, I integrated the layout system. Different modals, components, etc. can be integrated and reused flexibly).

    *A custom hook was created for data fetching operations.

    *I used skeleton for the smoothness of data fetching operations.

    *all components update context api. and data is transferred to the used parts with the context provider.

    *Axios library was used for requests in the project.

    *Context API was used as state management.

    *The .env file for api key and baseurl was installed and used.

    *animations, transitions and all styling operations were done with tailwind css.

    *I wrote the entire project with tailwind, I did not use styled components to save time.

    *used swiperJs for slider.
